## Description
An animal management program.

Currently supports 3 types of animals:

1. Cassowarys
2. Cats
3. Crocodiles


The program allows you to:

1. List all animals
2. Add animals
3. Remove animals
4. Find animals
5. Play an animal's noise
6. Age up an animal



## Design Notes
- No individual print information in menu, that is replaced by the find animal method. All animal's info is printed in the list all option.
- Also added an option to remove animals from the list for operational purposes.
- Unsure if we were to implement an option for the user to add custom animals; no idea if its possible to dynamically create classes with our current skillset.
- Accessors and Mutators remain in the abstracted Animal class but are protected; unsure if this is proper procedure.
